              IICA is a mobile app for creators, artists and influencers: a place to discover people, view their profiles,
              find collaborators, attend events, take classes and shop.
            </p>
            <p>
              My contribution is the app’s interactive prototype, shown here, which I built fully with AI to work out
              these flows. You can tap through it in the browser.

            A creator describes the collaborator they need in their own words, then reviews suggested matches one card at a
            time and opens the details behind each one.
