 * Outside the brief: Jb's art, studio and personal photos, kept apart from Ideas in

 * materials, places or dates, and personal photos are never credited as "photography by" Jb.
 * Files are optimised copies in public/gallery; a few screenshots are cropped to drop
 * interface chrome (a "1/2" counter, a "•••" menu, a scrollbar, white side bars) without
 * touching the artwork. `mono` photos are grayscale only where shown outside the Gallery
